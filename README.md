# SWG-Mods
Collection of SWG mods that I have made.

## Silent Crafting Stations Mod
* does exactly what the name implies

## No Squint Mod (v2 release 3/26/2018)
* This mod resizes elements / increases font sizes for <b>1920x1080</b> screens (I do not have a 4k screen or I would make a separate version for those).
* Entertainer image designer has been redone so that the color palletes are easier to see.
* Crafting windows tweaked for readability and also color pallettes.
* Mail, various lists and dialogues.
* There's actually just too much to list here. Try it out, if you don't like it you can always delete.
* (more updates to this one will be coming as I have not gotten to everything yet, check back for updates)

## Installation
Just download and extract to your base SWG game folder.

## Uninstallation
Simply delete the files it placed in your SWG/ui folder.
